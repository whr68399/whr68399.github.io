<h1>If There's a Whistle There's a Way</h1>
<p>I can't sum up the essence of my family's dog in three paragraphs, so I'll tell a quick story of how our portly yellow lab's kidnapping led to his incredible fitness journey. Bexley is a portly English Yellow Lab. He has kind eyes, a quirky personality and the most ferocious appetite I've ever seen in a lab. The dog was born hungry.</p>
<p> Bexley reputation precedes him, he's notorious to the neighbors for scavenging around the street, sniffing here and there for any scraps of food fit for a dog. Some neighbors give him treats, other times he resorts to squeezing through our back fence to go dumpster diving in another neighborhood. Bexley knows he has a good life so he always comes back, there's no need to build a fence to enclose him. Except for one time he didn't come back. We noticed hours had gone by and promptly panicked when we realise our beloved Bexley had gotten trapped on the other side of the fence. He was kidnapped.</p>
<p> To make a long story short, we got our boy back (ridiculously enough this wasn't the first time someone swiped him). We had to do something to make sure he wouldn't roam off for good next time he went out adventuring. So we found a GPS tracker for him that goes on his collar. It's called a 'Whistle' and we can pull the app up on our phones and see where Bexley wanders throughout the day. What's amazing is that it acts like a FitBit. He has a fitness goal everyday and we can see the calories burned and the miles walked. And after only a couple months of having his Whistle, Bexley went from a 100 pound UNIT to a svelte 86 pounds! We are so proud. </p>
